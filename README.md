# Locale APP Documentation
### Introduction
The Locale API provides detailed geographic data about Nigeria, offering developers access to information on regions, states, towns and local government areas (LGAs). This RESTful API is built with Node.js and TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhanced development experience.
### Features
- Authentication: Secure API access through API keys.
- Search: Flexible search capabilities for regions, states, towns and LGAs.
- General APIs: Access to comprehensive lists of regions, states, towns and LGAs.
### Prerequisites
Before setting up Locale API, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB or MongoDB Cloud
- Typescript
- An HTTP client (like Postman)
### Getting Started
1. Clone the Locale App repository from GitHub:
``` markdown
git clone https://github.com/Chisquare7/Locale-APIs.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` markdown
cd locale-app
```
3. Install dependencies:
``` markdown
npm install
```
4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
``` markdown
npm run build
```
5. Set up environment variables:
  - Create a .env file in the root directory.
  - Define the following environment variables in the .env file:
    - PORT: Port number for the application (e.g., 4050).
    - DB_URL: MongoDB connection URL.
6. Start the application:
``` markdown
npm start
```
7. Access the Application: Once the server runs, you can access the application at `http://localhost:<PORT>` in your HTTP client (like Postman).
